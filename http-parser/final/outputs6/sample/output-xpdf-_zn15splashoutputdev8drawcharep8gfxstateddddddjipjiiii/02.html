<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &#34;SplashOutputDev.h&#34;
#include &#34;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&#34;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size &lt; 1)
    return 0;

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  double x = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  double y = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  double dx = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  double dy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  double ox = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  double oy = stream.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  CharCode char_code = stream.ConsumeIntegral&lt;CharCode&gt;();
  int nBytes = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange&lt;int&gt;(1, 5);
  GBool adjust = stream.ConsumeBool();
  GBool fill = stream.ConsumeBool();
  GBool need_font_update = stream.ConsumeBool();
  
  const Unicode u = 65;  // Unicode representation of &#39;A&#39;
  const Unicode *uPtr = &amp;u;

  GfxState gfx_state;
  SplashColor paperColor = {0xff, 0xff, 0xff};

  // Create the SplashOutputDev instance
  SplashOutputDev splashOut(splashModeRGB8, 4, gFalse, paperColor);

  // Start a new document
  splashOut.startDoc(nullptr);

  // Fuzzed function call
  splashOut.drawChar(&amp;gfx_state, x, y, dx, dy, ox, oy, char_code, nBytes, uPtr, 1, adjust, fill, need_font_update);

  return 0;

}  
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
The error message is missing in the question, therefore, it&#39;s not possible to provide an exact fix for the code. However, based on the given code, some potential issues could be:

1. Missing libraries for GfxState, GBool, CharCode, Unicode, and SplashOutputDev. These types are not standard C++ types and are likely defined in some libraries not included in the code. You should include the necessary headers for these types.

2. The function drawChar might expect some parameters to be non-null. If this is the case, you should make sure to pass valid pointers instead of nullptr.

3. The GfxState object is used without being initialized. This might cause undefined behavior.

Without the exact error message, it&#39;s not possible to provide a definitive solution. However, you should start by including the necessary libraries and initializing your objects properly.

Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (xpdf) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
