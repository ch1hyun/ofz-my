<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
The function &#39;SplashOutputDev::doUpdateFont&#39; seems to be inaccessible from outside the class as it is a private method. Private methods are meant to be used only within the class they belong to and not called directly. They are utility methods that serve as helpers to other (public) methods that are designed to be used outside of the class. We cannot test a private method directly in a fuzzing harness. 

Thus, it is not possible
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
fuzz_JBIG2.cc:1:1: error: unknown type name &#39;The&#39;

&lt;/error&gt;


Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (xpdf) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
