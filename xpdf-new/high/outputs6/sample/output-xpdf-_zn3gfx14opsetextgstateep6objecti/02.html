<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include &#34;Object.h&#34;
#include &#34;PDFDoc.h&#34;
#include &#34;Stream.h&#34;
#include &#34;Dict.h&#34;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fdp(data, size);
  
  if (size &lt; 3) {
    return 0;
  }

  int numArgs = fdp.ConsumeIntegralInRange&lt;int&gt;(1, 3);

  Object dict;
  dict.initNull();

  std::string name = fdp.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  int64_t refNum = fdp.ConsumeIntegral&lt;int64_t&gt;();
  int64_t refGen = fdp.ConsumeIntegral&lt;int64_t&gt;();
  
  std::vector&lt;Object&gt; args(numArgs);
  args[0].initNull();
  if(numArgs &gt; 1) {
    args[1].initName(name.c_str());
  }
  if(numArgs &gt; 2) {
    args[2].initRef(refNum, refGen);
  }

   // ---------------------------------------------------
   // In order for opSetExtGState to work, the args array should contain Ref type objects that can be found in the PDFDoc catalog.
   // In this context it&#39;s not possible because the PDFDoc instance cannot be controlled and hence we can&#39;t add objects in it&#39;s `xref` atrribute.
   // Also it&#39;s not possible to create a dummy `PDFDoc` because it&#39;s constructor is private.

  // Gfx *gfx;
  // gfx-&gt;opSetExtGState(args, numArgs);
  
  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
The error message is not provided, so I can&#39;t provide a specific solution. However, based on the comments in the code, it seems like there is an issue with the `opSetExtGState` method and `PDFDoc` object. 

If the constructor of `PDFDoc` is private, you might consider creating a factory method or a friend class that can access the constructor. Alternatively, if you have access to the `PDFDoc` source code, you could consider making the constructor public or protected.

If `opSetExtGState` requires a `PDFDoc` object, you could consider modifying the `opSetExtGState` method to accept a null `PDFDoc` object or to create a default `PDFDoc` object if none is provided.

Without additional information, it&#39;s hard to provide a more specific solution. However, the general approach would be to modify the code to accommodate the requirements of the `opSetExtGState` method and the `PDFDoc` object.

Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (xpdf) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
