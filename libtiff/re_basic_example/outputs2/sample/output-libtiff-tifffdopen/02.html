<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &#34;tiffio.h&#34;

struct FileCloser {
  FILE *file;
  ~FileCloser() {fclose(file);}
};

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  std::string open_mode = stream.PickValueInArray({&#34;r&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;a&#34;});
  
  FILE *tmpfile = fopen(file_name.c_str(), open_mode.c_str());
  FileCloser file_closer{tmpfile};  // Use RAII to close tmpfile.
  if (!tmpfile) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  int fd = fileno(tmpfile);

  // Call the function under test.
  TIFF *c_tiff = TIFFFdOpen(fd, &#34;MemTIFF&#34;, &#34;r&#34;);

  if (c_tiff) {
    TIFFClose(c_tiff);
  }

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code can build successfully but has a runtime issue: Fuzzing crashed immediately at runtime (ASAN-ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x7f9c81751ddb bp 0x000000000000 sp 0x7ffc272923b0 T0)), indicating fuzz target code for invoking the function under test is incorrect or unrobust.

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &#34;tiffio.h&#34;

struct FileCloser {
  FILE *file;
  ~FileCloser() {
    if(file) {fclose(file);}
  }
};

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  
  const std::string file_name = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString();
  std::string open_mode = stream.PickValueInArray({&#34;r&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;a&#34;});
  
  FILE *tmpfile = fopen(file_name.c_str(), open_mode.c_str());
  FileCloser file_closer{tmpfile};  // Use RAII to close tmpfile.
  if (!tmpfile) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  int fd = fileno(tmpfile);

  // Call the function under test.
  TIFF *c_tiff = TIFFFdOpen(fd, &#34;MemTIFF&#34;, &#34;r&#34;);

  if (c_tiff) {
    TIFFClose(c_tiff);
  }

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt; 

The problem was that the fclose function was called on a null pointer in the FileCloser destructor. This caused a segmentation fault. The solution is to check if the file pointer is not null before calling fclose.
