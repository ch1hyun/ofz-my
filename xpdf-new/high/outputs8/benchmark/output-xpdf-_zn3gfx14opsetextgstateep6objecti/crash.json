This could be due to the headers not being in the include path, or the headers might not exist. The solution would be to ensure that the headers are in the correct location and are correctly referenced in the include statements.\\n\\n2. The `BaseStream` and `Gfx` classes might not have a default constructor. If this is the case, you would need to provide the necessary arguments when creating a new instance of these classes.\\n\\n3. The `somePublicFunction` function might not exist in the `Gfx` class. You would need to replace this with a function that does exist in the `Gfx` class.\\n\\n4. The `Gfx` class might not be in the global namespace. If this is the case, you would need to prefix it with the correct namespace.\\n\\nWithout the specific error message, it's impossible to know which of these issues (if any) are causing the build error.
