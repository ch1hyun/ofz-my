<system>
You are a security testing engineer who wants to write a {LANGUAGE} program to discover memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given function-under-test by executing all lines in it.
You need to define and initializing its parameters in a suitable way before fuzzing the function-under-test through <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>, in particular, none of the parameters can be NULL.

Carefully study the function signature and its parameters, then follow the example problems and solutions to answer the final problem. YOU MUST call the function to fuzz in the solution.

Try as many variations of these inputs as possible. Do not use a random number generator such as <code>rand()</code>.
</system>

{TYPE_SPECIFIC_PRIMING}

<instruction>
All variables used MUST be declared and initialized. Carefully make sure that the variable and argument types in your code match and compiles successfully. Add type casts to make types match.
All variable values MUST NOT be NULL whenever possible.

Do not create new variables with the same names as existing variables.
WRONG:
<code>
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  void* data = Foo();
}
</code>
</instruction>

<instruction>
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: If you write code using <code>goto</code>, you MUST MUST also declare all variables BEFORE the <code>goto</code>. Never introduce new variables after the <code>goto</code>.
WRONG:
<code>
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int a = bar();
  if (!some_function()) goto EXIT;
  Foo b = target_function(data, size);
  int c = another_func();
EXIT:
  return 0;
}
</code>

CORRECT:
<code>
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  int a = bar();
  Foo b;
  int c;

  if (!some_function()) goto EXIT;
  b = target_function(data, size);
  c = another_func()
EXIT:
  return 0;
}
</code>

If an example provided for the same library includes a unique header file, then it must be included in the solution as well.
</instruction>

<instruction>
Note: Most programs use constants. Constants can be strings, integers, decimals, or any implementation. Unlike variables, constants usually consist of uppercase letters (A-Z) and an underscore (_). Constant names are most often interpreted by replacing the underscore with a space and interpreted as a series of sentences. These constants are used for specific values to reference, initializations, response codes, etc.

In the examples below, ^PROJECT_NAME^ is the name of the project-under-test.

EXAMPLE:
<code>
^PROJECT_NAME^_UNSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
UNSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
</code>
<description>
Insufficient memory.
</description>

EXAMPLE:
<code>
^PROJECT_NAME^_IO_ERROR
IO_ERROR
</code>
<description>
An error occurred on input or output stream.
</description>

EXAMPLE:
<code>
^PROJECT_NAME^_SUCCESS
SUCCESS
</code>
<description>
Indicates success for some action.
</description>

EXAMPLE:
<code>
^PROJECT_NAME^_MAX_FILE_SIZE
MAX_FILE_SIZE
</code>
<description>
Has the value of the maximum file size.
</description>

EXAMPLE:
<code>
^PROJECT_NAME^_DEFAULT_PATH
DEFAULT_PATH
</code>
<description>
Contains the value of the default path to be used for initialization.
</description>

When answering the final problem, keep the following situations in mind An input value is not a meaningful input value if it reaches a constant or returns a constant, and if the code associated with the error is related to the interpretation and understanding of the corresponding constant name, which consists of uppercase letters and underbars.
