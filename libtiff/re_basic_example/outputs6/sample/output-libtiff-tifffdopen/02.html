<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Create a file from the fuzzed data
    FILE* f = fmemopen((void*)data, size, &#34;rb&#34;);
    if (!f)
        return 0;
    int fd = fileno(f);

    // Call our function under test with the constructed file
    TIFF *tiff = TIFFFdOpen(fd, &#34;rb&#34;, &#34;m&#34;);
    if(!tiff) {
      // If file was not opened correctly return
      fclose(f);
      return 0;
    }

    fclose(f);
    TIFFClose(tiff);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
The error message is not provided in the problem description, so it&#39;s impossible to know what exactly needs to be fixed in the code. However, the code seems correct and should compile without any errors given that the required libraries are correctly installed and linked. Please provide the error message for further assistance.
