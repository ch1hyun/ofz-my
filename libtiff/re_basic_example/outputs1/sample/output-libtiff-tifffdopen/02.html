<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.hxx&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  std::string text_file_name = &#34;/tmp/temp.tiff&#34;;
  
  FILE * temp_file;
  temp_file = fopen (text_file_name.c_str(), &#34;w+&#34;);
  if (temp_file == NULL) exit(1); //  Failed to open a file.

  // parse data as text and write it to a file.
  std::string s(data, data+size);
  fprintf(temp_file, &#34;%s&#34;, s.c_str());
  fclose(temp_file);

  TIFF* tiff = TIFFFdOpen(fileno(temp_file), text_file_name.c_str(), &#34;r&#34;);
  if (!tiff) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  TIFFClose(tiff);
  
  // Clean up created file
  remove(text_file_name.c_str());

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
The provided error message is empty, so I&#39;ll assume the problem is that the file is closed before it is opened with TIFFFdOpen. Here&#39;s the corrected code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.hxx&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  std::string text_file_name = &#34;/tmp/temp.tiff&#34;;
  
  FILE * temp_file;
  temp_file = fopen (text_file_name.c_str(), &#34;w+&#34;);
  if (temp_file == NULL) exit(1); //  Failed to open a file.

  // parse data as text and write it to a file.
  std::string s(data, data+size);
  fprintf(temp_file, &#34;%s&#34;, s.c_str());

  // Reopen the file in read mode for TIFFFdOpen
  fclose(temp_file);
  temp_file = fopen (text_file_name.c_str(), &#34;r&#34;);
  
  TIFF* tiff = TIFFFdOpen(fileno(temp_file), text_file_name.c_str(), &#34;r&#34;);
  if (!tiff) {
    fclose(temp_file);
    remove(text_file_name.c_str());
    return 0;
  }
  
  TIFFClose(tiff);
  fclose(temp_file);
  
  // Clean up created file
  remove(text_file_name.c_str());

  return 0;
}
```

In the fixed code, the file is closed and reopened in read mode before calling TIFFFdOpen. After TIFFFdOpen, the file is closed again if it couldn&#39;t be opened as a TIFF file.
