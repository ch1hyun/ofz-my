<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &#34;SplashOutputDev.h&#34;
#include &#34;GfxState.h&#34;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  if (size &lt; 5) return 0; 

  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data_provider(data, size);
  double dx, dy, originX, originY, tOriginX, tOriginY;
  CharCode code;
  Unicode intext[10]; 

  dx = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  dy = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  originX = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  originY = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  tOriginX = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  tOriginY = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeFloatingPoint&lt;double&gt;();
  code = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeIntegral&lt;CharCode&gt;();
  for(int i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
    intext[i] = fuzzed_data_provider.ConsumeIntegral&lt;Unicode&gt;();
    
  GfxState st(72.0);
  SplashOutputDev color_mode(splashModeRGB8);
  color_mode.drawChar(&amp;st, dx, dy, originX, originY, tOriginX, tOriginY, code, 1, intext, 1, 1, 1, 1);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
