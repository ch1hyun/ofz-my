<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
Please note that the mentioned function &lt;code&gt;void SplashOutputDev::doUpdateFont(GfxState *)&lt;/code&gt; is actually a private member function of the &lt;code&gt;SplashOutputDev&lt;/code&gt; class in the XpdfReader library. In the general sense, private member functions are not meant to be directly invoked outside the class implementation. Therefore, it would be unusual and contrary to standard practice to use it directly in the fuzzing process given
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;


Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (xpdf) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
It seems there has been a misunderstanding. The provided text is not a valid C++ code. It&#39;s more like a comment or explanation about a function in the XpdfReader library. The error messages are also not valid C++ error messages. They are just indicating that the provided text is not recognized as valid C++ syntax.

Without the original C++ code, it&#39;s impossible to provide a valid solution. Please provide the original C++ code that needs to be fixed.
