<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:

In the fixed code, the read_func() function signature has been changed to match the required signature for the 4th argument of the TIFFClientOpen() function. The type of size1 and size2 parameters has been changed to tmsize_t and the return type has been changed to tmsize_t. The datasource parameter type has been changed to thandle_t.

The solution is to check if the subdir is greater than 0 before calling the function TIFFSetSubDirectory. This is because the function TIFFSetSubDirectory expects a non-zero subdir. This change will ensure that the function under test is effectively invoked and fed with non-null input, thereby increasing code coverage.

  TIFF *tif;
  tiff_data tiff_data;
  tiff_data.data = data;
  tiff_data.current = tiff_data.data;
  tiff_data.size = size;
  tif = TIFFClientOpen(&#34;MemTIFF&#34;, &#34;r&#34;, &amp;tiff_data,
                       read_func, nullptr, nullptr,
                       nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);

  if (!tif) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  uint64_t subdir = stream.ConsumeIntegral&lt;uint64_t&gt;();
  
  // Check if the subdir is less than the size of the data before calling the function
  if (subdir &lt; size) {
    TIFFSetSubDirectory(tif, subdir);
  }

  TIFFClose(tif);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

The fix was to check if the subdir is less than the size of the data before calling the function TIFFSetSubDirectory. This ensures that the function is called with valid input, maximizing the fuzzing result.

<h3>Fixer prompt #5</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;

#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;

#include &#34;tiffio.h&#34;

struct tiff_data {
  const uint8_t *current;
  const uint8_t *data;
  size_t size;
};

// Proxy read function for tiff_data
tmsize_t read_func(thandle_t datasource, void *ptr, tmsize_t size) {
  tiff_data *data = (tiff_data *)datasource;
  tmsize_t len = size;
  if (data-&gt;current + len &gt; data-&gt;data + data-&gt;size) {
    len = data-&gt;data + data-&gt;size - data-&gt;current;
  }
  memcpy(ptr, data-&gt;current, len);
  data-&gt;current += len;
  return len;
} 

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {

  // Create a TIFF file using callbacks to our mock data
  TIFF *tif;
  tiff_data tiff_data;
  tiff_data.data = data;
  tiff_data.current = tiff_data.data;
  tiff_data.size = size;
  tif = TIFFClientOpen(&#34;MemTIFF&#34;, &#34;r&#34;, &amp;tiff_data,
                       read_func, nullptr, nullptr,
                       nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr);

  if (!tif) {
    return 0;
  }

  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);
  uint64_t subdir = stream.ConsumeIntegral&lt;uint64_t&gt;();
  
  // Check if the subdir is less than the size of the data before calling the function
  if (subdir &lt; size) {
    TIFFSetSubDirectory(tif, subdir);
  }

  TIFFClose(tif);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
