However, I can provide a general guideline on how to fix common build errors.\\n\\n1. If there is an error message about a missing library, include the library at the beginning of the code. For example, if the error message is about a missing string library, add `#include <string>` at the beginning of the code.\\n\\n2. If there is an error message about an undeclared identifier, make sure that the identifier is declared before it is used. For example, if the error message is about an undeclared identifier 'TIFFOpenOptions', declare it before using it like `struct TIFFOpenOptions {...};`.\\n\\n3. If there is an error message about an unknown type name, make sure that the type is defined before it is used. For example, if the error message is about an unknown type name 'TIFF', define it before using it like `typedef struct {...} TIFF;`.\\n\\n4. If there is an error message about a missing function, define the function before it is used. For example, if the error message is about a missing function 'TIFFOpenExt', define it before using it like `TIFF* TIFFOpenExt(const char* name, const char* mode, TIFFOpenOptions* options) {...};`.\\n\\n5. If there is an error message about a missing header file, include the header file at the beginning of the code. For example, if the error message is about a missing header file 'tiffio.h', add `#include <tiffio.h>` at the beginning of the code.\\n\\n6. If there is an error message about a missing namespace, add the namespace before the code that uses it. For example, if the error message is about a missing namespace 'std', add `using namespace std;` before the code that uses it.",
