<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s impossible to create a fuzzer for the function you provided. The function is located in an anonymous namespace which means it has internal linkage. It&#39;s only accessible within the translation unit where it&#39;s defined, we can&#39;t even declare it in other files, not to mention calling it. Creating a fuzzer requires the function to at least have external linkage so it can be called outside of its translation unit.
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;


Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (abseil-cpp) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
