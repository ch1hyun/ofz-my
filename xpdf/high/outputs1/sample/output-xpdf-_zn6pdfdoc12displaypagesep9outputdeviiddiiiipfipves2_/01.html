<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:

&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
The target function `void PDFDoc::displayPages(OutputDev *, int, int, double, double, int, GBool, GBool, GBool, DW_TAG_subroutine_typeInfinite loop *, void *)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void PDFDoc::displayPages(OutputDev *, int, int, double, double, int, GBool, GBool, GBool, DW_TAG_subroutine_typeInfinite loop *, void *)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.

Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: DO NOT include the header file memstream.h in the generated fuzz target again, the file does not exist in the project-under-test.
If the non-existent &lt;filepath&gt;memstream.h&lt;/filepath&gt; was included for the declaration of &lt;code&gt;void PDFDoc::displayPages(OutputDev *, int, int, double, double, int, GBool, GBool, GBool, DW_TAG_subroutine_typeInfinite loop *, void *)&lt;/code&gt;, you must replace it with the EXACT path of the actual file &lt;filepath&gt;#include &#34;/src/xpdf-4.05/xpdf/PDFDoc.h&#34;&lt;/filepath&gt;. For example:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &#34;#include &#34;/src/xpdf-4.05/xpdf/PDFDoc.h&#34;&#34;
&lt;/code&gt;
Otherwise, consider replacing it with some of the following statementsthat may be correct alternatives:
&lt;code&gt;
#include &#34;/src/xpdf-4.05/xpdf/Stream.h&#34;
