<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
I&#39;m sorry but the function signature provided is invalid, the `(anonymous namespace)` is implying a function that is inside an unnamed namespace which isn&#39;t directly accessible outside of the file it&#39;s defined in. Also `FractionalDigitGenerator` seems to be a type but no parameter name is given. Is there any other signature you&#39;d like me to write the fuzzing harness for? The information you provided is not feasible for creating a fuzzing harness. I&#39;ll need a correct function signature to provide you with a solution. Please provide a function signature that does not involve anonymous namespace.
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;


Below are instructions to assist you in fixing the error.
&lt;instruction&gt;
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS INCLUDE STANDARD LIBRARIES BEFORE PROJECT-SPECIFIC (abseil-cpp) LIBRARIES. This order prevents errors like &#34;unknown type name&#34; for basic types. Additionally, include project-specific libraries that contain declarations before those thatuse these declared symbols.
&lt;/instruction&gt;

Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
