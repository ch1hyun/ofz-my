I&#39;m sorry, but without the actual code, I can&#39;t provide a solution to fix the build error. Please provide the code to get a proper solution.

<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
I am sorry, but it&#39;s not possible to fuzz the function in the provided signature since the function is not part of a public API and this setup does not allow creating realistic instances of the objects. The function usage heavily rely on being called from within other member function calls like `Gfx::go` due to the stateful nature of the `Gfx` object, where it expects certain conditions to be true.
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
The target function `void Gfx::opSetExtGState(Object *, int)` was not called by the fuzz target `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.YOU MUST CALL FUNCTION `void Gfx::opSetExtGState(Object *, int)` INSIDE FUNCTION `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
