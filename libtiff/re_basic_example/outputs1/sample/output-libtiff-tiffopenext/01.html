Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;

&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.

<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Without the error message, it&#39;s hard to provide a precise solution. However, there are several issues that can be spotted in the provided code:

1. The `TIFFOpenMemstream` and `TIFFCloseMemstream` functions are not standard libtiff functions, so they will likely cause a compile error. You might be trying to use `TIFFClientOpen` instead, which allows you to provide custom I/O functions.

2. The `TIFFOpenOptions` structure is not a standard libtiff structure. You might be trying to use `TIFFClientOpen` which requires a set of function pointers for custom I/O, but not in a structure.

3. The `fprintf` function at the end of the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is not complete, which will cause a syntax error.

4. The `#ifdef TIFFDefaultDirectoryCheckIsTile` block seems to be trying to use a macro as a feature check, but such a macro does not exist in libtiff. If you&#39;re trying to set some options conditionally, you&#39;ll need a different method.

5. The `openMemory`, `openURI`, `unmapMemory`, `sizeMemory`, `closeMemory`, `allocMemory`, `reallocMemory`, `freeMemory`, `appendMemory`, `closeURI` are not declared in this scope.

6. The `FuzzedDataProvider` class is not a part of standard C++ or libtiff, it&#39;s a part of LLVM&#39;s libFuzzer. Make sure you have the appropriate headers and libraries to use it.

Without knowing more about what you&#39;re trying to do, it&#39;s hard to provide a more specific solution. You might want to consult the libtiff and libFuzzer documentation to learn how to use these libraries correctly.
